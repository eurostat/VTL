The VTL 2.0 (Validation and Transformation Language) interpreter and the sandbox user interface
----

The interpreter implements all operators defined in the VTL 2.0 Reference Manual (see https://sdmx.org/?page_id=5096). It is suitable for developing both interactive tools or validation and transformation services.
The sandbox is a simple user interface for learning and testing the VTL language.
